# Django Session SFIT 2022

This repo has the slides and examples that we discussed during the session. It also has the django-todo app that we deployed.

## Create Virtual environment

After cloning the repo you need to create a Virtual environment using the following command and install django for working with the examples.

First install virtualenv package globally

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```
Open cli in the folder of the cloned repo and then create env
```bash
virtualenv env
```
To activate the env (For windows, For other OS you can easily google)
```bash
env\Scripts\activate
```

## django-todo
For the working with the todo app you have to install its requirements first. So while you have already activated your env cd into the django-todo folder and install the requirements
```bash
cd django-todo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
